## About pdf-utils
The **pdf-utils** application was born from the need to group many pdf files. This need emerged during a Udemy course, this course is made up of 8 modules and each module includes n lessons associated with n questions, each lesson has a pdf attached. Each pdf has the first page of the title page and the last blank, consequently, only the remaining ones contain relevant text. 

The idea was to merge all the pdf pages containing relevant text for each module and obtain a handout to print and study, without useless pages.

The folder structure is shown below.
